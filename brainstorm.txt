This plaintext document outlines my thought process while designing
this application.

Solar-year = 365 Earth-days

Let's not consider leap years.

Expected input:
User's age
User's life expectancy
User's chosen planet

Expected output:
The user's age in other-planet-based years. 
The user's years remaining to live in other-planet-based years.
