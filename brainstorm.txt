This plaintext document outlines my thought process while designing
this application.

Solar-year = 365 Earth-days

Let's not consider leap years.

Expected input:
 - User's age
 - User's life expectancy
 - User does not pick a planet

Expected output:
 - Display output for each planet listed in the next section below.
 - The user's age in that planet's years. 
 - The user's years remaining to live, based on that planet's years.


To achieve this:

Define a class object with the following properties.

Planet 	       Planet's year in Earth years

Mercury	       0.24
Venus	       0.62
Mars	       1.88
Jupiter	       11.86

Define a method to subtract the user's current age from life expectancy to get
Earth years remaining to live.

Build an output array from the following.

For each planet, convert current age and life expectancy from Earth
years into that planet's years.
