This plaintext document outlines my thought process while designing
this application.

Solar-year = 365 Earth-days

Let's not consider leap years.


Expected input:

 - User's age

 - User's life expectancy

 - User does not pick a planet


Expected output:

 - Display output for each planet listed in the next section below.

 - The user's age in that planet's years.

 - The user's years remaining to live, based on that planet's years.


To achieve this:

Define a class object with the following properties.

Planet 	       Planet's year in Earth years

Mercury	        0.24
Venus	        0.62
Mars	        1.88
Jupiter	       11.86

Define a method to subtract the user's current age from life
expectancy to get Earth years remaining to live. If the user's age is
higher than the life expectancy, instead output the number of years
the user has lifed past their life expectancy.

Output 1:

 - User's age in Earth years.


Output 2:

 - User's Earth years remaining to live. OR

 - How many Earth years the user has lived past their life expectancy.


Note, we haven't converted from Earth years yet.

Build an output array from the following.

For each planet, convert current age and life expectancy from Earth
years into that planet's years.
