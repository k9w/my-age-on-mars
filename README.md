## Description

Welcome to my second Independent Project in Intermediate JavaScript at
[Epicodus](https://epicodus.com).

I started it on Friday February 4th 2022. [This project's
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/tdd-with-javascript-independent-project)
in the [curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com/) says no User
Interface is required. The project will focus on Business Logic in the
JavaScript files. This means no HTML or CSS will be added beyond what
came from my [template
repo](https://github.com/k9w/template-repo). Nor will the project be
published to Github Pages.
