## Description

Welcome to my second Independent Project in Intermediate JavaScript at
[Epicodus](https://epicodus.com).

I started it on Friday February 4th 2022. [This project's
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/tdd-with-javascript-independent-project)
in the [curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com/) says no User
Interface is required. The project will focus on Business Logic in the
JavaScript files. This means no HTML or CSS will be added beyond what
came from my [template
repo](https://github.com/k9w/template-repo). Nor will the project be
published to Github Pages.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Fork the project to your own Github repository if you plan to make
  changes._
* _Clone the project from your repo to your machine or preferred
  location and cd into its folder._
* _Install webpack and other packages listed above and in package.json
  with 'npm install'._
* By default, the packages are installed locally
  to the project folder. That way, if you decide to not continue with
  the project, you can cleanly remove it and all its dependencies by
  just deleting the project folder.
* _Build and bundle the project from the src/ folder into the dist/
  folder with 'npm run build' or 'npm run start'._
* _Run the pre-defined tests with 'npm run test'._
* _Observe what the application does._
* _To add to and improve the project with Test-Driven Development
  rules, add your ideas to brainstorming.txt. Then modify or add to
  the tests first, then write new code and see if the tests pass._
* _If you like this project, please contribute issues and especially
  pull requests to improve it._

## Known Bugs

* _Any known issues_
